One idea into a script somebody finishes.

Score hooks with the `score_hooks` tool (pass a list of hook lines). Do not eyeball the hook.

## Before you write

1. Read `/voice.md`. That is the creator's voice profile: how they talk, the words they never
   use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it is still the blank template,
   work from `/AGENTS.md` and say in your reply that the voice profile needs filling in.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## The shape

**The first 15 seconds is the whole job.** It does three things or the video leaks: confirm the
click the title promised, open a question the viewer cannot close, and prove the payoff exists.

1. **Hook.** Write FIVE against [the 21 formulas](hooks.json), run them through `score_hooks`,
   keep the top two, and show the user both with their scores. Never hand over one hook.
2. **The turn** (0:15-0:45). Say what the video is going to do, in one sentence, and start doing it.
   No channel intro, no "before we get started", no subscribe pitch. Those are the single most
   common cause of the 0:30 cliff.
3. **The body.** One idea per beat. Mark each beat with what is ON SCREEN, not just what is said -
   a talking head with nothing to look at is a podcast.
4. **The payoff.** Deliver the thing the hook promised, explicitly, and say that you are delivering
   it: "that is the prompt, it is in the description".
5. **The close.** One ask. Not three.

## What to hand back

- the two best hooks with their scored panels
- the script, beat by beat, with `[ON SCREEN: ...]` on every beat
- the runtime estimate at 150 words per minute
- one line naming which formula the winning hook used and why it fits this idea

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. Write your output to the studio path you were given and reply with a
short summary the producer can act on. If you need something only the person has (a number, an
export, a transcript), say exactly what is missing instead of guessing. Rendering a video always
waits for the person's approval.
