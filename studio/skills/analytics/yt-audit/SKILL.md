# yt-audit

An audit that lists twenty problems is a way of avoiding the one that matters. This ends in ONE fix.

## Before you write

1. Read `/voice.md`. That is the creator's voice profile: how they talk, the words they never
   use, who they are talking to, what they will not claim. If it is still the blank template,
   work from `/AGENTS.md` and say in your reply that the voice profile needs filling in.
2. Never invent a number, a result or a source. If a figure would strengthen it and you do not have
   one, ask for it or write the line without it.

## What to look at, in this order

1. **The last ten titles, as a set.** Read them as a list, the way the channel page shows them. Do
   they promise different things? Run them through `lint_title`. A channel where every
   title is the same shape has a format problem, not a title problem.
2. **The thumbnails, at feed size.** Shrink them. What survives? If three of them are unreadable at
   that size, that is the fix and nothing else matters yet.
3. **The first fifteen seconds of the three most recent.** Transcribe them and score with
   `score_hooks`. This is where most channels lose.
4. **Upload rhythm.** Not frequency - CONSISTENCY. Six videos in one week and then nothing for a
   month is worse than one a fortnight forever.
5. **The retention shape**, if they can export it. the `yt-retention` skill.

## What to hand back

- The single biggest fix, named, with what to do this week.
- Three things that are already working, so they do not break them. Be specific; "your energy is
  good" is not an observation.
- What NOT to do yet, and why.

Never open an audit with praise you do not mean, and never end one with a list of twenty things.

## The gate

Nothing here publishes. Write your output to the studio path you were given and reply with a
short summary the producer can act on. If you need something only the person has (a number, an
export, a transcript), say exactly what is missing instead of guessing. Rendering a video always
waits for the person's approval.
